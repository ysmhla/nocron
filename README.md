# noCron - PHP Cron Alternative in PHP & Self-Resurrecting Task Scheduler

noCron is a **lightweight PHP task scheduler** designed as an alternative to traditional cron jobs. It allows you to run PHP scripts or external URLs at regular intervals **without system cron access**. Ideal for shared hosting, small projects, or quick automation.

---

## âš¡ Why noCron?

Traditional cron jobs are powerful but come with limitations:

- Requires server-level access (SSH or control panel).  
- Difficult to modify dynamically.  
- No built-in web monitoring.  
- Limited on shared hosting environments.  

**noCron solves these problems:**

- **Web-based setup & manager UI**  
- **Self-resurrecting worker** ensures continuous execution  
- **Dynamic task configuration** without editing server files  
- **Runs anywhere PHP is available**  

| Feature | Cron Jobs | noCron |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Setup | Server crontab | Web installer |
| Flexibility | Fixed schedules | Adjustable interval/window via UI |
| Access | SSH or control panel | Browser-based |
| Monitoring | Logs or email | Manager UI shows status & allows updates |
| Portability | Server-specific | Any PHP-enabled server |
